            <!-- Bio be like-->
                <p id="bio1">I was born and raised in Lancaster Pennsylvania. I have played video games since before I could walk, 
                    and have played them nearly every day
                    of my whole life. My favorite game right now is Heroes of the Storm where I am a savage in the Tank, Assassin, 
                    and Solo-Laner roles.
                    I am trying to quit video games for the time being and focus on my career.
                    If i can get as good at coding as I was at playing Heroes of the Storm, then I believe I could get any job I want.
                    And the job I want is to become a Full-Stack developer.
                    <br>
                    I went to school for Mechanical engineering and I currently have an engineering job. While in school I was exposed to alot of
                    engineering specific coding which I enjoyed a lot. I do like my current job, but my dream Is to use coding to solve
                    all of my problems from engineering to business to robotics you name it. I know coding is an important part of life right now
                    and will be a critical role in the future so I know I have to get in it now and learn all I can.
                </p>

                <div class="bio">
                        <p id="bio2">Taking this bootcamp will teach me how to keep learning everyday again. A lot of times you reach your goal
                            like getting a bachelors degree and you think you are done learning. Being a developer, things are changing rapidly
                            and new technologies are being created every day so you have to keep learning in this field. That is what attracts
                             me to it.

                        <p id="bio3">I plan to can become a better coder, because right now as you can see
                            I am not that good.
